Hello! I am also studying for the july MCAT and was wondering if you would want to mostly silent skype study together? I think having someone that is studying day and night for the same test as you is really motivating so you are more effective and take less breaks. I'd be down to go over concepts at the end of the week as well, and review/share what we both studied. I am currently enrolled in a Kaplan course, and want someone else to study with! Let me know if you would be interested in studying together! E-mail me at: swati.samtani@gmail.com

so it looks like you are the only one who is from the Baltimore area and scheduled to take the October exam.
Let me know if you are interested in reviewing a few times as needed only after establishing exactly what one needs to work on; my strength are in RC and avg on LG; LR is something I am striving to improve the most, with my goal score being 165+; as mentioned in my status update, I have access to UMBC and therefore often study at their campus library-which can be a convenient study session; they even have a 24hr study lounge.

With best regards,
Daniel

Dear Syed,
How are you doing? I noticed that you are interested to take the GRE test. I am, as well, planning to take the test in December and willing for a big score. Do you mind if we get to know each other and keep in touch regarding progress in studying? I am from Sudan, living in Emirates at the moment and I am that kind of ppl getting bored quickly from study routine. Moreover, no one of my friends is taking the test. If you are interested, we can share study experience. I hope I hear from you soon. Good Luck!

Hi,
I am also preparing for GRE. Would you like to join with me to study?
Hi, I'm new to this service but just saw that you're in the Boston area and studying for a November date. 

I work in the financial district (near S. Station), and am mainly looking for someone to compare notes with about resources and study techniques

I am currently working with an older set of Manhatten prep books given to me by a friend who's already taken the GMAT.  I also have the official guide.

Much of my prep work has been focused on math (my lowest score on the practice/diagnostic test).   If you need help with Verbal, that's my strong suit.

Thanks and looking forward to hearing from you
Hi Moyukh, 

 I am looking for serious study pals in melb for gmat. let me know if you are interest.3

Dear Mitul,
I am planning to sit for the GRE in early December. I am preparing from several sources however I need guidance for ultimate progress. Math part is ok for me compared to verbal section, however, I am aiming to master both. My goal is to apply for PhD scholarship in US. Therefore, I really need to get to a high score. I appreciate if you could help me with tips and best study plan. At the moment I am in United Arab Emirates, so tutoring will be online. I appreciate if you could help me with my studies. If it is ok with you, we can further discuss on tutoring plan and fees.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Hi
Hello Rohit,

How are you doing?
Hey, I've just started studying for the June 2014 LSAT as well.  Study partners are pretty scarce considering none of my friends want to go to law school, and not many people start preparing this early.  I have the Powerscore Logic games, Manhattan LG,LR, RC books, as well as Master the LSAT by Nova.  The beginning of LSAT study typically involves just reading/drilling through the prep books, so it may be a good idea to share resources if you're interested in that as well.  Let me know if you'd like to start studying anytime.  I'm currently taking classes, but I'd be available weekdays after 1 on Tue,Thur.  And Anytime on MWF.  I have class until 1 pm. on Saturday ,but asides from that I'll be available on weekends.

Hey Hannah,

I'm also looking for a diligent study partner for the June 2014 LSAT and looking to score  above 175. I would say my best section would be logic games as I rarely miss a question for those questions. But LR is another entirely different beast, so that would be the section for me to improve most upon. What books/resources have you been using?


Hi, howz preparation going on ?  all d best

Hey Anthony,

I am looking for a study partner for USMLE step I. I am thinking maybe Skyping twice or 3x a week or something 1 month before the exam and maybe once a week before that. I have never studied with anyone over the internet. The thing is that if you do it with friends, it takes forever to get anything done (we always get off track), but with someone online, I imagine you can be really efficient. Are are looking for something similar?

Hi Alison! 
I was wondering if you wanted to be online study partners? I work full time and it's so hard to find time to study. Maybe we can email back and forth daily to see how much studying we each did? Let me know, thanks! Bekah

Hey :-)
Hi, Do you want to study together for GMAT?
Hi Alex, don't know if you're done with your studying but just in case you aren't, I'm happy to coordinate a study session. sometimes just having the pressure of a study buddy helps! (or at least for me it does!) Rgds -Andrea

Hello!

Hey Andre,
I'm also looking at studying for the GMAT and was wondering if you wanted to join up to study for the exam? I also work for a retailer and would be looking to get as high a GMAT score as possible. Would be good to share strategies/keep each other on track during the revision period, so if you think it would be something you're interested in give me a shout back.

All the best,

Alex

Hey Govind. Am studying for the GMAT at the moment, but was wondering if you wanted to be an online study pal? Basically we could skype/email/facebook and help each other stay on track with studying. What do you think?
Hi!
I am taking the mcat on July2nd. When are you taking yours?

Hi,
My name is Michelle taking 2014 June test and possibly Sept/Dec. I took a TestMasters Prep Course last October and covered several materials including Bible, Manhattan books, 7sage etc. I have been on a leave from work in order to completely focus on studying – this shows how much I am serious and determined. I am looking for someone who can share this motivation and be a support each other. 
 I live close to Down town Los Angeles, CA. So I would like to meet up if you live close to here. I also found Skype or Phone are very good communication tool and convenient. I am down to talk any time. I would like to take a Mock PT together and review. Please contact me at 213.700.3059 or michellemoon0708@gmail.com. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Hey Andre, don't know if you saw my message but would be keen to join up with someone as a study pal for the GMAT. I've got a lot of the materials for the GMAT, but would be good to have someone to help motivate each other through the preparations. I did the accountancy exams with PwC and know how tough they can be, so would be good to have someone to work with for the GMAT to help each other.

Hi, my name is Mai Thoi. I am looking to initiate a consistent study schedule. I have been studying on and off for months due to a lack in motivation and study frustrations. However, I am hoping to find a study buddy who may be able to help me in my areas of weaknesses as well as help me to adopt a hopeful routine study schedule or something close to it.  Would you be interested in this partnership?

Hi Nouf khalid,

I have been looking around for a MCAT study buddy and was wondering if you found one yet. I want someone to keep me motivated and more accountable for studying, like a workout buddy, but for the MCATs. I've started this task since late January after MLK Day, but have definitely not been as productive as I've hoped. I am using TPR material and bought their self-paced online course. I also have a bunch of ExamKrackers stuff that I've collected over my years in college and some Kaplan stuff although not complete. I feel the Kaplan textbooks are misplaced, but I have some of their practice exams. I have more than enough material to work through, but I've been looking around for a study buddy to make this all seem less daunting. I have a full-time job, but would be able to meet evenings and weekends. Let me know if you are looking for someone as well!

Hello. Are you done with your GRE ?
I would like to study with you if you have no problem. My number is 8172170846
Hello. My Name is Omolayo I am studying for my MCAT as well. Would like someone who understands what is needed to excel above a 30 and is dedicated to meeting weekly. 
Hello Cecilia, Are you still studying to take the MCAT? I would like someone who can meet weekly if possible and knows what it takes to excel above a 30. Thank you!
Hello My name is Omolayo and I am studying for the MCAT as well. I would like to study with someone who knows what it takes to excel above a 30 as well as someone who is dedicated to meeting weekly or multiple times a week. I live in Tenley Town so it would be easy to catch up with you. Please let me know ASAP. Thank you!
Hello My name is Omolayo, I'm not sure if you have already taken your exam but if not. I am in DC and looking for someone to meet with weekly and bounce off study ideas. I am proposing to take my exam in July but may postpone it to august or september. Would appreciate the feedback. Thank you. 
Hi - 
I'm male with work experience in San Jose. I'm interested in finding a dedicated study partner to discuss/review questions regularly for the June'14 test. I'm scoring well on PTs already at 170+ but I'd like more improvement. Talking about LSAT with others on a regular basis makes one motivated to improve and discussing PTs and reviews can provide the benefit of two minds over one. 

So I hope to find someone to meet up with once per week over skype phone call. I propose that we 
- meet for 1-2 hours weekly 
- discuss lsat study done during the week and the scores on PTs 
- drill each other on sticking points for improving on lsat 
- other suggestions 

If you're interested in giving this a try, send me a message and we'll connect.

Hi H K,
I'm looking for a study pal for the LSAT.  I'm taking the exam in September as well.  Please let me know if you would like to meet and study together.
Thanks!

Hi Michelle,
I'm going to take the LSAT in September, but if you have some time, I would love to study.  Please let me know.  Thanks!
Hi,
My name is Michelle aiming for the 2014 Sept/Dec. I took a TestMasters Prep Course last October and covered several materials including Bible, Manhattan books, 7sage etc. I have been on a leave from work in order to completely focus on studying – this shows how much I am serious and determined. I am looking for someone who can share this motivation and be a support each other. 
I live close to Down town Los Angeles, CA. So I would like to meet up if you live close to here. I also found Skype or Phone are very good communication tool and convenient. I am down to talk any time. I would like to take a Mock PT together and review. Please contact me at 213.700.3059 or michellemoon0708@gmail.com. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Hi Kat. I'm looking for a study partner for the gmat. Although, you and I could not really meet in person because of the distance. I was wondering if you would be interested in having some practice sessions using skype. The share screen feature is helpful for this sort of thing. Let me know if your interested. We can talk about it. Ill be available for evening sessions. Cheers.
Well, you were the only person from Arkansas on here lol. I'm pretty far away though...I'm in Hot Springs. Well bummer...I'm staying at my grandparents' house this summer to study for the test while they're away in Colorado, but judging by your picture there, you have a BF, and he and my GF probably wouldn't appreciate it if we roomed together lol. Well, best of luck on your test, and maybe I'll see you at UAMS!
Hi, let me know if you want to study together...

Hi,

Hope you are doing good. My big day is on June 12, but I am extending it as I am not fully prepared. I am some plan for this prep, let me share mine and you can update your ideas on top of it. 

Books I have. 
1. 16 Veritas GMAT Prep. 
2. Barrons GMAT.
3. The GMAT book 

Plan, 
Every Veritas book is related to some math topic or verbal topic, and it has material to read int he start. Every week we should read two books material by ourselves. 

Group Study Plan, 
Let's get the the math practice questions together. This way we will minimized the effort of group study and we will not waste anytime.  

About myself:
I am an engineer, working for Qualcomm. I have done my masters from SDSU and I am planning for UCLA ONLY. 
I am comfortable with Math and English but worst part is to find time between my schedule. I am very social with so friends here in San Diego that's why I am too lazy to find time for GMAT prep. I can handle Math very easily as I have given GRE once but I need to work hard on Verbal portion. 

About yourself:

Hi
Hello,

Just signed up for this site here and saw your profile. I am looking to begin the process of studying for the GMAT, though I am a beginner in every sense. You will see by my profile that this is all relatively new to me, and I am looking to get the ball rolling.. I am looking for someone to hang out with who is studying the same materials so we could chat and ask each other questions if they come up, or just to have someone doing the same thing as I am. Weeknights and weekends would work well for me.

Let me know if you are interested, will look forward to hearing from you - 

All the best,

Justin

Hey hi Jingyi,
    I am also prepping for my GMAT exam in november, 2014 and looking for a study partner. I am quite strong in GMAT math (aced all the math subjects so far) but not as good in verbal as in Math.
    I am looking study partner, with whom i can compete and study for GMAT. Regarding the verbal section, I think two brains is better than one to figure out the solution.
    Let me know if you are interested.

Thanks,
Vinay Ari.

My name is Edward, and I'm also looking to take the exam around the same period.  My scores are directly the opposite of yours.  My math score is 168+, but my verbal is 150+.  Please let me know if you're free to meet sometime over the weekends/weekdays to study for the GRE.  

Sincerely, 
Edward

Hi Radhika.. As you have mentioned 'March 2014' as your Big Day, which probably means that you have taken your GMAT, so would you like sharing your experience with it and how Study Pal helped you in your preparation. I am planning to take GMAT exam in September and looking for few resources to study. Your review will certainly help me in selecting the best material and course-ware available. So please advise.
Thanks!

Hi Rachel,
I just started studying for the MCAT and although we're probably not at the same level, would be happy to study with someone and improve each other's weak areas. I also work during the day, so best time for me would be weekends/evenings.
If you want, you can email me and we can see if this may work for both.
Good luck!

Hi there,

My name is Michael and I'm also studying for the GREs.  I've been studying since April but my test was pushed back so now I'm reviewing but I'd like to start from beginning to end of verbal and quantitative.  Anyway I think it would help increase our scores if we put our efforts together and help teach each other the material rather handling it on our own.  What do you say?

Let me know if you would be interested in group studies. I stay in Aundh Road, and my email id is amol04gaikwad@gmail.com
Hi, I'm in desperate need of a study partner to keep me on track. I think my biggest issue is practice and committing to scheduling time. Pretty consistent with LR in missing -1 to -4 a section, highly inconsistent with games, and RC is an area of weakness (think -5 to -9).

Basically, I'm just looking for someone to take practice tests with and debrief afterwards. Let me know if you'd be interested!

Hi there,

I'm planning to take the CFA II in June 2015, again...'The past trials have been a proof that I can organize myself for the job, but I lack commitment for my personal projects (like this one). That's why I need a study pal with whom to establish and meet study deadlines and hopefully revive the "almost" dead ambition I used to have :)
I am planning to start the learning process on 1st of October 2014. I do not want to let this exam stress my life, but for sure I want to be very well prepared before taking it. It must be a way of making the CFA study a pleasant activity :)
My expertise is in financial services (valuations).

Please let me know if you still need a study pal to start working on our objectives...

Maria

Hi, Would you like to study for the GRE?
Hi Tanya, reaching out to you so we can help each other do well on the LSAT; based on your needs and mine, we may be a good fit together. I am very organized and study daily; a stickler for lists, schedules, reminders - I could certainly help hold you accountable for your studies; and by working together on problem-solving, perhaps you can help me jump out of comfort zones.

Hey, I just read that you used to live in Michigan...So did I!:)
yes! - Michigan State Alum. Was there this past weekend for homecoming. I am in the same boat as you - I am targeting november but i'm not sure if thats realisitic at this point. i am trying to not have to retake this test. i am using the GMAT pill course to study for this and its not bad at all. Its actually pretty annoying because i had studied and was on track to take the test in July but i had to move to Atlanta for a new job so that just messed up my plans so now I have to "re-study" for it. I live closer to downtown. How long have you been in Atlanta?

I can't seem to read people's personal bio, did you write one?

hey, im looking for a study buddy
hey I'm looking for a study buddy since I get easily distracted studying by myself.

I'm 28 yo m, graduated from UCD biomedical engineering living in koreatown.

Planning on going back to school for a masters since quitting my job as a personal trainer. Focus is GRE.




I'm about two weeks into my studying. Average about 70-80% in math and vocab sections, lower for reading comp. Goal is 170/170.




Hard-copy material wise, I'm using 2015 Cracking the GRE by Princeton Review, 1000 Manhattan flash cards, 1000 Memory Tricks and Mnemonic. I downloaded PDF copies of 5lb GRE practice problems, 2013 Cracking the GRE, 2014 Gruber's Complete GRE Guide, ETS Official Guide to the GRE Revised General Test. Online I use majortests.com.




I plan to take the GRE's before the month's end but really I have no timeline at the moment.

My name is Michelle. I have been preparing LSAT for more than a year. I took a TestMasters and 7 Sage prep courses; also covered several materials including LSAT Trainer, Bibles, Manhattan Strategies Books and Multiple PTs. I have developed several strategies and would like to share with yours. 
I made a decision to take a leave from work in order to completely focus on studying – this shows how much I am serious and determined. I am looking for someone who can share this motivation and be a supporter and a couch for each other. I’ve studied with few other people and found it very effective to analyze questions together and talk it out and explain to each other; way more than just listening to the lecture. I would also like to take the entire PT together under strict time limit. 
My Skype ID is michellemoon0708. I am down to talk any time. I am willing to work on any time frame/schedule. Please contact me at michellemoon0708@gmail.com. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Are you open to video-chat study sessions? Lol I know it might seem PRURIENT but I live with a significant other and honestly it could prove very convenient.

Hi Harkiran, hope you are well and had a great week. I'm Pierre and I currently work for Barclays in their Equity Finance trading division. Like you, I am also taking the GMAT in December and was hoping to find someone to study with once or twice per week to help supplement my current weekly classes and personal study sessions. Would you be interested in meeting by any chance in the evenings after work at the library or coffee shop? I work in midtown but could pretty much meet anywhere in the city as well. Please let me know what you think and I do hope to hear from you soon. 

Thanks,

Pierre

Hope to hear from you.

Hi Lindell - 

i hope this message finds you well. My name is Karla Figueroa, and I am a consultant who is currently starting to study for the GMAT. I've picked up the Manhattan GMAT set, and I am nearing the completion of the "GMAT Roadmap" book. I think it'd be very advantageous to have a study partner to meet with about once a week. On my diagnostic exam, I overwhelmingly scored much better on the verbal section compared to the quantitative, so if you are a Quant buff, we will surely complement each other! If not, we can help each other through those tough quant questions. My target date right now is fairly flexible, but I'd like to take the exam around March/April 2015. I'd be willing and able to meet either in the evenings after work or on weekends, around noon. Please feel free to email me or message me on here to follow up! Looking forward to hearing from you. 

Cheers, 
Karla

Hi Karla,
              I have started on 2013 but stopped due to personal reasons. I have started again only last week. We can meet once and try quant but if I am really lagging behind then it is better for you to study with someone. Please let me know the chapters that you want to study together. I live in White Plains but work on Wall Street. Please let me know where do you want to meet ?

All the best

Hi Ama, curious if you're still looking for a study buddy! I'm pretty much open after 6:00 p.m. Monday through Friday and all day Saturday and Sunday. Currently scoring at a 165-170 (that inconsistency within the range is pretty disconcerting) and could use an accountability partner. On weekdays, near Capitol Hill is easier for me, though I'm flexible for weekends. 

My email is coatsvictorialin@gmail.com if you're interested! Thanks!

I am Palak. I just completed Masters in Economics from National University of Singapore (NUS). I want to start my career in risk management and I feel FRM would be apt to gain the skills and competencies required. I have not started preparing for it and I am not sure whether 4 months are enough for the preparation. I do not have a strong quant background. Can please give me a few tips as to how should I go about it? Do you believe in self study or are you taking classes like edupristine?

Hi Elle!

It seems that russian language has not been supported here. How are you doing? What is your target GMAT score and have you taken full practice exam?
Hey there! I noticed your post about studying for DAT (my parents are dentists too!).

Hi, I need a partner to go over first aid in 2 weeks, this will be my final review. My weakness is that I take too long to read through it but I need to do it faster so I can take my exam by december 20th. Please let me know if you are interested or if you have a better approach. we can do it over Skype. Thank you!
Hi I'm taking the MCAT in January as well. Which part of LA are you in? I'm still doing content review for the next few weeks, having someone to study with would be helpful in staying focused. 
Hi, I am studying for USMLE step 1 as well and doing my final review of first aid and uworld. I tend to take a lot of time going over things on my own because i lose track of time, let me know if going over first aid is something you would be interested in. we can Skype or FaceTime. let me know if this is something you will be interested in or if you have another idea. Either way we can come up with something that can benefit both of us at the end. Thanks!

Hi Roman,

I was wondering if you were still looking for a study partner or if you have already taken the test.  I see that your "big day" was June 2014.  From reading your profile, I thought we had a lot in common in the process and was hoping we could study together.

Hi Tibby,

I also took the MGMAT course this year and had a similar experience, my verbal carried my score.  I am looking to retake the GMAT again and was wondering if you were still looking for a study pal.  

Olivia
Hi,I m shivendra I am one of a member of our group on fb, I saw your post on fb that you need study partner,I recently wrote cat 2014 n also preparing for snap,cmat and they will be held in d near future so if you need any type of help from me related to cat just let me know I will try to shortout your doubts n problems as much as possible...:)
Hey this is shivendra from bhopal,I just wrote cat 2014 and preparing from snap n cmat,I really need a study partner if you like to become my study partner dn plz do message me
Hi Olivia - 

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Karla Figueroa, and I am a consultant who is currently starting to study for the GMAT. I've picked up the Manhattan GMAT set, and I am nearing the completion of the "GMAT Roadmap" book. I think it'd be very advantageous to have a study partner to meet with about once a week. On my diagnostic exam, I overwhelmingly scored much better on the verbal section compared to the quantitative, so if you are a Quant buff, we will surely complement each other! If not, we can help each other through those tough quant questions. My target date right now is fairly flexible, but I'd like to take the exam around March/April 2015. I'd be willing and able to meet either in the evenings after work or on weekends, around noon. Please feel free to message me on here to follow up! Looking forward to hearing from you. 

Cheers, 
Karla

HI Deepti, I will be giving my GMAT in March. I am preparing alone and i am looking for Study Pals as it would help to keep the vibe and motivate us. And its imperative to have a group when preparing for exams like GMAT. Can i know in which Consulting firm are you working for, just out of curiosity. And also we have certain target schools in common, so i think going ahead we both can be of mutual help. 

Cheers,
Adarsh

Hey Ed!  
I'm studying for the USMLE step 1.  I'm just looking for someone who I can study "with" at nights (cause i usually just stop studying after 7pm) ... as in, I just study on my own but it'd be nice to have someone on a chat window/facetime/skype who says "Hey! I'm studying for 3 hours tonight, you?" and exchange goals for the 3 hour period and hold each other accountable at the end, or something like that... lol i know it's weird.  If you have any desire to give it a try though, holla!

Hi Ranjani. Let me introduce myself , I am Praneet , graduated from VIT in 2009. I am giving my GMAT in January. I have a month and half now. I don't wanna be attending any coaching classes rather I would like a group study. Where are you situated? Are you up for a meetup during the weekends? Any coffee shop. I have spoken to others also in this group.

If you think otherwise i completely understand.

Hi! I am trying to harness TOEFL so do you, let us help one another.





I would like to share my writings with you.
We seem to have quite a bit a in common! Unlike most of those taking the June 2015 on StudyPal.co, I am not on the West Coast. Also, I was in the military, Navy (1999-2005). And, also like you, I am very interested in the same law schools, plus my goal is also to score as high as possible - with 170 being my personal, minimum acceptable score. I think we might be good fit? Please check out my profile and tell me what you think. Any feedback is appreciated.
I am also planning on june 2015 and looking for a serious STUDY PAL . If you are still looking for a study pal do let me know

I am here for you
but i dont know how to use it
I love to joinn you guys in studies.
Hi Sasha!  I'm taking mine April 21 :)  I have a study buddy already, but I would be down to do a really quick daily check-ins (exchange goals for the day like "doing 40 questions by 8pm") with a followup at night to make sure we reached our goals, and could do every-2-hr check-ins once my study buddy finishes his test in February :)  

Right now my study buddy and i just correspond via gchat, set goals, and check in with each other to make sure we meet our goals to keep each other accountable ... and we have to do a punishment for every 5 minutes we got distracted (like pushups crunches or stretching).

If you like the idea of the daily check ins, let me know :)  Good luck, regardless!!

Hi Christopher, 

My name's Joshua, nice to (virtually) meet you.  Looks like you're just at the beginning of your studies.  Is that still the case, or have you made some progress?  I've been solo-studying for about 6 months now and am hoping to connect with fellow LSAT studiers in the city.  

Best wishes, 
Joshua   
Hi Candace, 

My name's Joshua, nice to (virtually) meet you.  Looks like you've been studying for a while, congrats!  I've been solo-studying for about 6 months now and have taken ~30 practice tests.  I used Powerscore's material as well, and found it super helpful.  I'm finally scoring in the 165-175 range, but am still having some difficulty with timing.  I'm hoping to score 170+ on test day.  If you want to connect and swap LSAT knowledge/advice let me know.  Happy New Year! 

Best wishes, 
Joshua

Hey Elizabeth! Hope you had a great new year. I noticed you are planning to take the LSAT in February, and I was wondering if you'd be interested in studying together! I'm taking 3 parts of the CPA exam in January, February, and April, so I'm going to be spending a lot of time at coffee shops/libraries trying to focus! Even though we are taking different exams, I thought it would be helpful to have a study buddy to meet up with and focus on getting through this rough time. Also, I took the LSAT in college (used testmasters), so I definitely remember what that was like! Let me know if you are interested!

Hi! 

I am looking for a study partner. Plan to take the exam by May 2015 at the latest. I am pretty good in PS,SC, and CR. Need to work more on DS and RC. This will be my first attempt. 

I am in the EST zone. I would love to study over Skype/Google Hangouts/Facetime. 

Let me know if you would be interested. 

My email id is gmatprepom@gmail.com

Hi if you want to make the group we are talking in ILETS group in facebook ,i am ready.
I am looking for study partner that support me in my english lessons

Hey Heidi! My name is Roshmi, and I'm a second year med student in Birmingham. I'm taking Step 1 in April too (on the 23rd), and I'm getting worried I'm going to end up cramming like I always do haha. I'd definitely be interested in texting and checking in on each other while we're studying. If we're working on the same thing, I'd be down to Skype and talk over things too. I didn't post my photo or name on here because I wasn't sure about this site initially and I'm too easy to find on Facebook. Let me know if you're interested!
Tag, machst du step 1 oder 2 ck?

Hi, I have just started preparations for CFA level 03. I have 9 years of work experience in the treasury field. So have good grasp of financial concepts. I am looking for a study partner for problem solving and someone who helps me keep on track for my study schedule.

Hi, I was wondering if you were still looking for a study partner! To tell you about me, I'm 26, work on the Hill, and did TFA right after college. As far as my LSAT performance, I'm applying this cycle, took the December test and scored a 165, but am looking to retake in February to hopefully get me off of the waitlist of some schools to give me better options. I'm usually around -3/4 for games and LR and -5 to -9 for RC, and at this point, I think I'm going to invest my efforts in the first set.

Nights and weekends are pretty much what I'm looking for, and around Capitol Hill is probably easiest for me, though I can make other things work. Let me know if you're interested!
Hello.

Hey Raja,
I used this site in October and found a partner to study the GREs with. I took the GREs about 3 weeks ago and did pretty well, scored 163V/165Q and 5 on the analytical writing. I studied A LOT and used every study book (Kaplan, Princeton, Barron, Gruber, Peterson's, NOVA) you can think of. I was shooting for 170 for my quantitative but messed up during the test haha. BUT I think I'm pretty knowledgeable about the material, and I'm also trying to scrape up some money for rent/food/living. I'm available for tutoring for $15/hr, I think the cheapest you'll find anywhere. My strength is math, but actually, percentile-wise, I did better in writing and verbal, ironic since my major was engineering in college. I live in Los Angeles and we can meet anywhere you like. You can email me at jonkai27@gmail.com.

If I recall properly, I also read a post from you on pagal guy. I am looking forward to stumble upon someone who can work with me on different aspects of the test. My kaplan mocks are ranging between 640-670, and am targeting 710+.
Let me know if you have a study group and I can step in on a quid pro quo basis.
Thanks,
Aishwarya

Hey! I'm studying for the USMLE step 1, which is in the end of April. Not sure which step you're taking, but if it's step 1, I would love a study partner to meet at a library sometimes to go through some questions. I like working separately but next to a person while I study and perhaps talking through things I don't understand..  My strength is respiratory (but it didn't recognize it for some reason). Perhaps if you're interested, we could meet beforehand for coffee and talk about our goals. Thanks! 

I live in Orlando Fl, I will love to have a study pal. Are you interested? My test is scheduled February 7, 2015.

Let me know if that has any interest to you.

take care

Hi Tomas, 

Mr name is Arturo.  I read your statement and it motivated me to send an email indicating my interest in potentially studying with you for the LSAT.  Unfortunately, my one option is limited to Skype as I am located far from Miami.  Let me know your thoughts, as this may be a long shot because I have no idea where you are at in your studies - for instance if I'm too late and you've already carved out a concrete study plan, studying with someone else, alone, etc.  Thanks!

Hi Karla! I'm Anton and I think you're just the right person I'm looking for :)
I'm good enough at quant (timing and careless are my biggest issues), but not so good at verbal (usually have more than enough time, but make stupid mistakes or choose a wrong strategy).
I study every evening after 6pm. I'm in midtown. I posted several threads on forums, but haven't found anyone yet.
What do you think?
Hi Peter! I'm Anton.
I think we're in the same boat. What's your availability?

Hi Swati... This is Lavanya.. I am currently living in Austin and pursuing CPA .. I came across your account while searching for a study buddy.. Do let me know if you wish to study together .. Least we could get our doubts solved or get a hang on complicated topics via phone or email.. Meeting up in person is definitely not possible.. But ya we can keep in touch and motivate and each other    .. Do let me know either ways ?

Hi Teriann,

I know that you have your day as February but I thought I'd message you anyway! Not sure if you're still studying for the GMAT, but if you are, let me know! I'm looking for someone to study with--I'm strong in verbal and weak in math so I thought it'd be a good fit. 

Cheers,
Emily
Hi Amanda,

I know you've indicated that you took the test last month but thought that I'd message you anyway to see if that was changed at all. I'm looking for someone to study with and was wondering if you were still up for it. Let me know! 

Thanks,
Emily
Hi Jasmine,

My name is Emily and I'm looking for someone to study the GMAT with! I've taken it before and was heavily skewed towards verbal so I'm looking to improve my quant. I was wondering if you've found success in finding a person to study with. I unfortunately live in Brooklyn but work in midtown. Let me know if you're free! :) 

Thanks,
Emily

hi, i have just started with step one. do u mind studying along with me?
Alessandra, I am a trainee lawyer living in Angel, Islington. How are you? I am just getting going at the moment, so my preferred mode of study would be for us to prepare certain topics and then go over them and work through some examples, maybe you think there are better ways? I'm pretty laid back. I studied Archaeology and Anthropology at Oxford. Let me know if you want to speak on the phone about exam preparation ideas. John
Aida, I'm in the same boat as you, I am a trainee lawyer and just getting going with preparation for June. How are you? Let me know if you'd like to speak on the phone about exam prep ideas. I am fairly laid back, but hard working! I live in Angel, Islington. John

I see that you're planning to take this test this month, are still looking for a study partner?
Hey Brian, 

I stumbled upon this site and your profile. I'm taking L3 in June as well and one of the hardest things I have with studying is being disciplined and resisting the temptation of the city. Thought maybe I'd give a study buddy a try to help stay on track even if we may be at different points. Just someone else to help with the time commitment needed. Anyways, if you have any interest, I usually make an attempt to hit the books in the evenings and weekends - let me know! 

Thanks, 
Liz 
We all are targeting a good score on the GMAT but getting there ain't easy.. So why not form a study pal group and help each other to gain momentum. What do you say fellas ???

Hey,

I am currently studying for the CPA.  I know you are studying for the MCAT but there seems to be a lack of CPA candidates in the Chicago area.  I am really looking for just someone/a few people to study with to keep me focused.  

A little about myself...

-I live and work in downtown Chicago.
-I also went to the U of I and just graduated in 2013 with an accounting degree.
-I'll probably be looking to study after work so from 7-11 PM.

Let me know if you are interested.

Thanks,
Chris

Hi Mandy,

My name is Marie and I live in the Seattle area.  I am also using Kaplan and Manhattan and prep4GMAT resources and will be taking my GMAT in April.  I am needing an accountability partner.  Are you interested in Skyping with me and studying together?  I mostly just need accountability.  I'm stronger in verbal and weaker in Math.  I find that when I review and help others, things stick a little better.  Let me know! -Marie 
Hi Vanessa,

I've been out of school for a while and my test is in April.  I need an accountability partner, would you want to Skype with me?  I am using similar materials (Manhattan and Kaplan mostly).  I have additional resources too, which I'm willing to share.  I find that when I teach and explain things to others, I learn them better.  Let me know! -Marie

Hello Marinda.  My name is Thomas.  I am also taking the LSAT in October.  I took it last September and scored a 158.  I preptested consistently at 165, so I was a bit disappointed.

If you're interested, my email is thomas.dequeant@gmail.com.

Hi Nyasha! I hope you are doing well. I am looking for a study partner for the June Exams--My strength is the logic games and have the challenge of being inconsistent with the logic reason. If interesting in being a study buddy, I would love to hear back from you. Have a wonderful day!
Hello Jina! I hope you are doing well. I am glad you are excited about going for the highest score in the LSAT in June, that's my goal as well. Reading your profile, you work in Public Policy, a course I majored in while studying at Pepperdine University's School of Public Policy. My goal is to get 175 at least; and together, I think we can work to get to the very top. I would love to hear from you. My personal email is kobbbina@gmail.com and phone# is 310-596-9318---Please call/text any time. Do have a great day!
Hi Mary,
Hope this note finds you well. I just got done with my step 1 and I'm looking for a study partner for step 2. Just thought I'd leave you a note. I just moved from India to San Jose a couple months back. Let me know if you are interested in a study partner or even just networking.

Hey guys, I am new on this platform. I am glad to find you all studying for the same exam as I do. I am planning to take the exam some  time next month. 
PMBOK is such a boring book to read but if we study together, I am sure it will help to get through the book and eventually the exam. 

Please let me know what you think about it. We can create a group and share our cheatsheets, short notes, etc. 

-Shri
Hi,

Hi are you still looking for someone to study with?

Yes can you pay me to be a study pal I have hardly any money saved up and the website is not providing financial aid. I'd be outside like a bum if I go to far. I love to chill in 5 star hotels in my free time and live the rich life while also getting a really high GPA. So studying is my main priority.
I work well with males but prefer females because of the school I grew up with.

Hi Mahalakshmi,

I saw a posting about this site on LinkedIn and thought I'd check it out.  I see you like studying in the morning whereas I am available Tuesday through Thursday after work but I thought I'd reach out anyway.  At this time I am only using the materials provided by the CFA institute but I see a few others use other study materials.  Let me know if you'd be interested in a study pal.

Thanks,
Al

Let me know if you're interested and looking forward to working with you.

Hi Raveesh,
I too am preparing for my second attempt at CAT this November.

I was hoping to find a study pal who could help me out with Algebra (mainly Quadratic Eq, 
Cubic Eq, Maxima-Minima and Co-ordinate Geometry).

All portions related to English are my strengths and I could help you out there.
Since I'm working, weekends work best for joint preparations.

I'm targeting a 99+ score this year, seeking admission to IIM A/B/C.

Do get in touch if you feel we could effectively contribute to each other's preparation :)

I may be reached on 9874 9675 99 too.

I'm targeting a 99+ score this year, seeking admission to IIM A/B/C.

Do get in touch if you feel we could effectively contribute to each other's preparation :)

I may be reached on 9874 9675 99 too.
Hi Areek,
I too am preparing for my second attempt at CAT this November.

I was hoping to find a study pal who could help me out with Algebra (mainly Quadratic Eq, 
Cubic Eq, Maxima-Minima and Co-ordinate Geometry).

All portions related to English are my strengths and I could help you out there.

Hello Roman
I am also preparing for PMP. Can we share some details and discuss for the group preparation.
Hey, I don't know if you are interested, but I am studying for the MCAT right now full time (to take on July 18th.)  I'm struggling to find anyone else who is studying for the MCAT right now, so I thought I'd send you a message.  I know my breadth of studying is a bit different/smaller than yours, but I think having someone else around who's in a similar situation could help.

I'm usually in one of the libraries in Northampton - if you're looking for a study buddy, let me know!

Hi..
Im starting usmle preparation..n would like to give exam after january 2016..do u like to have a study partner?

do you want to study for the mccat
Hi, are u still looking for a partner with gmat prep? My name is Anh', Vietnamese, but currently live in Russia. Nice to meet you. I also need a partner who is hardworking and passionate about studying as well. Really hope to hear from you.


hi r u interested for sp for step2 ck 
hi r u interested for sp for step2 ck my skype is mr.z900
Hey! Are you still looking for a study partner? I've never done this before, but I'm looking for someone to Skype with while studying. Independent study, but to talk to about topics.. review concepts, ask questions or for help when needed, those kinds of things. Really, just to keep each other on task! It's hard doing this alone I find. It'd be ideal if we could sync up topics, so when we talk about certain things we're both on similar pages. I study from 8am Central Standard Time until 5pm Central Standard time. Right now, its 9:39pm here (In Chicago Illinois, United States, but originally from Canada). I take an online review class from 5pm-10pm, so I can Skype with you during that time as well, but will be listening in on my review class. Anyways, message me back if this interests you!  
Are you interested in forming a study group for the MCAT? 
Hi I saw you message on linkedin skyscape question NCLEX RN and I join studypal then looked for you. I do not have a date yet but I want to prepare and get ready for the exam as I have a young son and it takes more time to study. I live in Australia, but I've always dream to work in the USA. We can study together or please let me know how this works. thank you. Maria

My GRE exam is in august 2015. I have already attended the coaching and need to review.

I reside at south delhi aiims area.   Thanks 
Hey,

I'm just now starting to study for the gre and am interested in making a study group with at least one other person because paying for courses is crazy expensive. Any interest in meeting up and studying together?

HI samay,
it seems you are also based in pune
ANd you are also appearing for cfa level 1..
Hello Niharika.
I got mailed that you're study pal from pune..
U joined any classes or just preparing yourself?
Hi Dilan-

My name is Yaneth and I was wondering if you would be interested in studying together via Skype. I would suggest practicing passages, taking FL test together, and sharing study tips.

Hi Niharika,
I am also preparing for CFA Level1 Dec'15 attempt. I am based out of Pune. Anyhow want to clear the exam this time. I am working in TCS, but find some time daily for studies. I think my efforts will be streamlined if I start studying with some one. At the same time, efforts can also be reduced and there will be effective learning. 
I have already started studying, but nothing much covered. Just finished with Alternative Investments and Portfolio Management (low weightage :P )
If it is fine with you we can start studying together. Initially we can start with the planning and then can move ahead with the Preps and mock tests. I have gathered the material for the same. It will be better if we can do it, there will be some discipline then. 
Hope to see your revert.
you can contact me

Hi JD, My name is Lina. I am also studying for CPA exam right now and my session will be FAR. I live in Germantown. I noticed that your big day will be August 2015. Not sure which session you will be taking but I will be taking FAR in Aug. I am looking for a study buddy, not matter if he/she studies FAR or not. As long as we have the same goal. Please kindly let me know if you would like to study together in the library :) My email is Lenali2321@gmail.com. I am using Becker and Wiley. My progress is little slow because I have been procrastinating but I am trying to be focused. It would be truly beneficial for both of us to study together so we can achieve our goal  to become a CPA ASAP.  Please let me know. Thank you :)

Hello
Hi, I am looking for a focused study partner or group that is preparing for the NCLEX RN. I live in Carmichael but am willing to travel in the Sacramento area as long as studying is the focus. I've been studying Hurst Review and recently purchased and began watching the Kaplan videos as well. I recently moved to CA from Texas and unfortunately don't know anyone looking to become a nurse to share ideas and thoughts related to NCLEX prep. I'm a male nurse wannabe.  I would love to pass the test the first time around. Thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you, Don. Even if I don't hear from you Good Luck on the NCLEX. I'm sure you will do great.

Hey Bridgette, its nice to see a fellow science person taking the LSAT. You would think we'd be better at Logic Games! I'm actually looking for other preppers who are weak in LG because we'd be able to motivate each other to drill more, not to mention gain more from trying to explain it to the other person. Let me know where you're at in your studying, and if you want to work together on this.
Hi Herman,
It looks like our timelines are pretty similar.  Did you find someone to study with?

Hey man, I see that you went to Hunter College! Not sure if you're studying with anybody, but seeing as how Hunter is probably convenient for us to both get to, it would make a great study spot. If you want to do preptests/blind review together, just let me know.
Hey Larisa, I see that you went to Baruch and I actually live a few blocks away from Baruch. If you wanted to study together, meeting at Baruch could be super-convenient for the both of us. I'm not sure where you're at in your studying, but let me know and maybe we can meet up.
yes that would be great, i just started studying with the bible and i have taken 7sage

Hi Abhi,
My name is Akshata and I too have my GRE in August. I live in Jersey city as well. Since I have my GRE on the 18th, I am currently giving mock tests and practicing by giving small timed tests. 
Let me know if you would be interested in studying together ? 
Thanks.
Hey Fernando! So I really liked that you were aiming for the top and I feel that that is a major contributor to a great study partner, one that can push me to better my best. Im going to be in San Diego during my studying but I was wondering if you would be down to Skype and become study partners that check in to see how progress is going and exchange tips to do better. Let me know if that sounds like something you'd be interested in. Have a nice day!

Hey Catherine! So I really liked that you were aiming for the top and I feel that that is a major contributor to a great study partner, one that can push me to better my best. I'm also studying pretty far in advance as well but rather do that then stress out 6 months away haha. Also I think it's pretty cool that we are both trying to get into Harvard Law.

Hey! How are you? It looks like were both in the same stage and aiming for the same school goals. I'm planning on taking the test in June but am starting to study now in order to alleviate stress and pressure in the future. I'm currently at Florida Atlantic University in Florida but go back and forth between here and New Jersey/New York about once a month. I've started taking a few practice tests but have reverted to the Logic books and then will be going back to the tests. With this test being so difficult and being the test that predicts your future, I think the best study tool besides the texts are study partners! With that, I was wondering if you would be interested in becoming study partners. Just to check in on progress, exchange tips, thoughts, questions, etc, via Skype/Email. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!

Hello Kat, 

My name is Brendan and I noticed we are on the same boat. Last time I studied for the MCAT I went solo as well, and I did not do as well as I would have liked. I would much rather study for this with a partner, and I was wondering if you wanted to team up. I know that distance will likely be a factor, but I am willing to brainstorm ways in which we could get around it. 
I hope to hear from you soon and good luck on everything.

Best 

Brendan
 Actually i only stay in New York in August and then i will back to China. I am traveling in USA and preparing Gmat here at the same time. i am here looking forward to find a partner who can study together even i back to China. Besides the content of test, English is another obstacle to me( My mother language is Cantonese), by the way, my Toelf is 101 ( reading is 30(full score). Hoping to meet a friend here. Chinese is good at Math? Indeed. But i need little time to review this part because i have not learned math for a long time. The university i attended and my target school in the profile is wrong(only usa college in the option).  IF we match, please contact me. My email is pengzianzyec055@gmail.com

Hi Alexander,

I wanted to see if you're still looking for a study pal. I'm studying for the GMAT so I can't content-share with you, but it'd be great to have someone I'm accountable to. I have the most time to study on the weekends (typically I study at home or at coffee shops in Back Bay) but could also do evenings or early mornings. Let me know if you'd like to study together!

Best,
Jillian

Morning.  We have a study group of two in Santa Cruz, and am reaching out to gauge interest in expanding.  Unfortunately I know most folks do not want to drive over the mountain during the week if they don't have to, but we also plan on adding some Saturday sessions starting in September, though we could consider sooner.  How is your studying going?  Have you fond any groups yourself?  Would you be interested in coming to Santa Cruz?  That's not to say we won't try to move the group over there if we find more interest and a venue.

Thanks,
Brian

Hello
Stephen -- Did you get through your Level 1 CFA exam? If so, how soon do you plan to begin preparations for Level 2? I'm thinking about getting an early start for June 2016 L2 exams. If you're of like mind, maybe we can get a study group going. (I know we had talked in the past but never got anything going, and after my level 1 experience, I can definitely see value of periodic meetups to discuss and review subject material). Let me know what you think.

Hi ! I am going to appear in December. right now i am in Saudi arabia. while registering on website there was no option given for test center in riyadh or jeddah. in recent June my test center was in Riyadh, marriot hotel.

Hi Akarkshi,

Looks like you'll be taking the annoying exam (haha) at the beginning of next year?
I'm hoping to take it within this year. There is someone else on this site (in austin) who is planning on taking it this year. 
Want to link up and perhaps study together soon?

Hello,

I briefly messaged you both today, seems like we are all in it to prep to GRE. Though I would add us all to a group. 

I was mentioning to to Zulfiqar that I intend to start studying Wednesday morning. I will most like study everyday for a few hrs till the end of August (when Fall semester starts), and then study on the weekends/ every few days in September. 

I took a prep class this summer, but didn't do much of the prep. I have all the materials that I need (through Kaplan), and simply need  to actually put in study time every day. That's where I thought studying in a setting with others in the same boat, might help me stay on task.

What are you all looking for and what do your schedules look like?

I'm hoping to get started ASAP.

Regards,
Remona

Hey, How are you? I am also preparing for CFA-I for Dec-15. just wanted to say hi. 
Hi Chinmaya,

This is Ramender Mall. I have recently moved from India to Frankfurt. I have around 10 years of experience in software domain (30 years old).
 I work for a software company from last 5 years - that provides solutions for Fixed Income Domain (And recently added much more).

I thought about learning about business a bit more in details - hence CFA 1.

I will write the exam in Dec 2015. 

I figured it will be better to have some kind of a study group - to track the progress and exchange notes - make it a bit interactive.

Please let me know if you are interesting in syncing up.. 

Cheers,
Ramender

Looking for a study partner. Can discuss the current status if you are willing to discuss and study.
well I'm working on the quantitative analysis now, there are a lot of concept of formulas that I find myself having to memorize. 
How did you tackle that? Did you use flash cards? 
Do you have any other techniques you would suggest?
I see that you used Kaplan, do you feel like the material prepared you well for the exam?
Did you do additional problems/exercises that are not provided by Kaplan?
Honestly I'm looking for any tips that you might be willing to share on how to best get prepared for the exam.

Hi Jennifer, 

My name is Mike Briggs and I'm a CPA candidate.  I've currently for FAR (75 yikes) and AUD (83 a little better) in the books.  I just found out a didnt pass REG (72, that hurts haha).  I'm taking BEC tomorrow.  Honestly, I rushed my REG studying.  I wish I had taken more time but oh well.  Not sure how I'm feeling about BEC just yet but we'll find out soon enough.  

Anyway, I'm most certainly studying for REG again starting next week.  If you're interested, you're more than welcome to join me.  I'm using Becker.  I have access to an office downtown in government center fully equipped with conference rooms, projectors, etc.  And starbucks is right around the corner.  

A little about me...

Grew up in MA, currently live just north of the city.  I have my masters in Accounting and an MBA, both from Umass Boston.  I did my undergrad work at Umass Amherst (econ).  I work for the MA Dept of Revenue.  

If you're interested, let me know!  I want to get this thing over with ASAP, its a time consumer haha.

Hey Guys !
I was planning to make a whatsapp group for those interested in giving CAT and other competitive exam in 15 or 16. Its always fun to study together rather than being bored at home trying to focus on preparation.
Its a beginner stage initiative we will add more members in our group so finding a study-pal would become easier. You can drop me a sms or whatsapp me at 9999356856. Hope to hear from you all soon.  
Regards
Jatin

Hii, I have recently registered for June 2016, CFA lev 1. As I belong to engineering background similar to yours from a NIT so CFA and finance stuff are new to me. But I have huge interest for this field and aiming to pursue in this sector in future. So can we make a schedule and strategy for it and study in sync. 
Hii, I have recently registered for June 2016, CFA lev 1. As I belong to engineering background unlike yours (accounting background) so CFA and finance stuff are new to me. But I have huge interest for this field and aiming to pursue in this sector in future. You have a upper hand in this field so could help me in solving my doubts regarding CFA studies. So can we make a schedule and strategy for it and study.

Hi Raluca,

As you can also see from my profile what determined me to clear CFA.
I see you have already attended Exam in 2015. I hoped it was a really successful one for you.

I would like to ask you what are the study materials to use, If you have Scheweser 2015 notes I would like to buy it or rent as you prefer.

I will be really grateful if you reply, being a foreigner i find it difficult to get hold of things here in Romanian Market. 
Not sure where to get the study materials from.

Thanks
Ankit

Hi Zoey, my name is Shirley.
Do you want to perhaps study together? 
I need a study partner to keep me motivated so that I don't slack off. 
I prefer to do it just 1 on 1 instead of a large group.
I am also using Kaplan and I am almost done looking through the books (I only have biochem left).
(the problem is that I don't recall much of what I read).
How far are you in in terma of studying for Jan MCAT?
I forgot to say, I am a junior at Occidental College and come home during weekends. I live in Harbor City, which is very close to Torrance. (I went to South High School). If you want, we could meet up at Katy Geissert/Henderson/Walteria on weekends. Or we could skype...

HI! . My name is Tiffany ! I'm 21 I'm aiming for my test to be Dec 11 2015. I am nervous and want to have someone to bounce ideas with. 
Hi Sophie,

My name is Sihui (Izzy/Isabella is my alias as I don't want to expose too much personal info online), and I'm also taking Dec 2015 and glad to find you here! I usually like to study alone but still be part of a study group, in which I can stay motivated, discuss questions and vent stress when needed. I studied LSAT briefly for a month two years ago and got an okay decent score. This time, I aim for at least 170. I live in FiDi and work at a start-up with very flexible schedule. Let me know if you would like to meet up to crack LSAT together, or have any other ideas about LSAT. My email address is sihui.zhu01@gmail.com. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Cheers,
Sihui
had you gone through the test already?
Hello, 
I was wondering if you'd be interested in talking more about being study partners. I noticed we're both testing for April 2016 and work full-time so it seems we are in a similar boat.
I've been studying with the Examkracker books and have a study schedule outlined till about January currently based upon the EK books, Khan Academy Psych, and Biochem online videos.

Let me know,
Vi

Hi Shelly, I am currently studying for the GMAT and I plan to take the exam in November. I noticed you have the same target date. I recently took one on the 29th of September and scored 620 (Q47 V28). As you can tell, verbal is not my strongest area and I need to improve this area. Interestingly, my practice exams were a lot better. I believe that having a studypal to discuss with will help me home in my skills and also help me better identify my strengths and weaknesses. I currently work for PwC and the office is at mid-town. I am available to meet up in the evenings after work and on weekends. Let me know if you will be interested in working together. My email is pawosoga@gmail.com. Thanks!

If you want some help, feel free to join in. Also, I saw that your college is Hunter. I graduated from there too!
Hey,
I was wondering if you'd like to team up with me and study for step 1. I've been out of touch with basic sciences for a while. Looking to study from the beginning. I'm looking for someone to study with who's in the beginning stages of their prep.

We'll give each other a time limit to cover every topic, at the end we'll do questions together. I'll motivate you, ill push you beyond your limit. Lets team up together and destroy this exam. 

I live in Toronto. If you live close by, we can study together. If not then we can skype. 

Let me know if you're interested! thanks!

Hi Sunny, Pleasure to e-meet you.  I saw your profile and perhaps you and I can study together. I am neither looking for a tutor since I can study on my own.  I have taken the tests already ones, but I would like to take it again to try to get a better score and increase my chances when applying to school. I want to also do a masters is Psychology.  I am looking to apply at Columbia University and NYU.  I graduated from school over 10 years ago. I had worked for a while, but I am ready to go back to school. I am dedicated and focused. I am looking to collaborate in this process, so I can stay on track and motivated. Let me know if you would like to talk about studying together. I rather to study at libraries or at home since I need quiet places to concentrate.  I can't study at coffee shops or laugh places. I can study almost every day from 10am to 8pm. I am not working currently, so I have flexibility on my schedule. Let me know. Looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you, Laura

hey Elie, I'm studying for the January 2016 MCAT and could use a partner. Let me know if you want to meet up somewhere between Irvine and Garden Grove!

Hi Guys,
I am scheduled to take the PMP exam on 12/12/15.  My current study plan is as follows.  Please note that I started off at the beginning of the book but decided to reverse my study routine and work from the back to the beginning instead.  I also skipped studying Framework in detail. I just skimmed over it, so you won't see it listed on my below study plan. Basically, I created a study plan where I am spending 3-5 days on each chapter (depending on the complexity), and then I take at least 3 exams for that knowledge area and move on to the next chapter. My plan is to start reviewing everything I've studied and start taking comprehensive exams on November 28, which is 2 weeks before I take my exam.  The chapter exams I am using are Rita Mulachy, PMstudy.com, Edwell Book and sometimes Andy Crowe Book.  I also have an App on my phone called PMP Genius that has tests organized by chapter.  Please keep in mind that this is my 2nd time reading the PMBOK and Rita book.  Therefore, if this is your first time, the below study plan may not work for you because you may need to devote more time to understanding the concepts.  


Oct 22-23 - Processes - Completed reading PMBOK, Rita Mulachy Chapter and did practice exams in Andy Crowe Book, Rita book, PM Study and Edwell book
Oct 25-27 - Integration - Completed reading PMBOK, Rita Mulachy Chapter and did practice exams in Andy Crowe Book, Rita book, PM Study and Edwell book
Oct 28-29 - Stakeholder - In progress
Oct 30-11/1 - Procurement
11/2-11/5-Risk
11/6-11/8-Communications
11/9/-11/11-Human Resources
11/12-11/14-Quality
11/15-11/19-Cost
11/20-11/24-Time
11/25-11/27-Scope
11/28-12/13-Review and take comprehensive exams


My skype id is rmayner. Freeconferencebridge.com is also an option.  I think meeting once a week for a couple of hours would be good, but I'm open to whatever you guys would like to do.  I'm thinking the focus of our study group should be to go over tests we've taken and then discuss our answers.  Does everyone use the Rita Mulachy book? If so, that's the book we could use for our discussions.  My e-mail is rzmayner@yahoo.com.  I am on eastern standard time. Also, please note that I can change my study plan around to accommodate wherever you all want to start up. Thanks!
So I just need an LSAT study partner to keep me accountable and actually study with like once a week. Not sure what you're up for?

Look whom i bump into..
Okay.. That's good... Have you joined any coaching? 
Okay good.. I too want to join FMS. For that we need 99 percentile. As of now I have not decided to join any classes, but will think about it after taking few mock tests. We need to have a concrete plan. How would you like to do it? 
Okay. Not a problem. I will start with some basics and by the time you are done with your exams, I believe, I would be able to come up with a good plan and some material. You can contact me here or on 9899899147.. 
Good luck for your exams pal.. :-)

Hi, would you be interested in studying together? 
Hey,

I'm pulling together a study group (nicknamed "The GMAT-attackers" ;)) of motivated test takers. The criteria for group members is 1) a desired score of 700+, 2) decent familiarity with the structure and content of the test (perhaps due to having taken a GMAT prep course or completed a self-study guide), and 3) a willingness to work hard!

The group is scheduled to meet after work from 6-9pm during the week and possibly in the late afternoon/at night (5-9pmish) on weekends for those in the group who want to put in some extra work. We will meet at a coffee shop by Grand Central Terminal (for ease of commuting).

If you're interested in joining the group, just shoot me an email at gtmalls@yahoo.com with the subject line "GMAT Study Group" and I'll fill you in with more details!

Your fellow GMATter,

Greg

I have just started out and am using Manhattan Gmat as a study resource. Cheers, Govind

Hi Sunny! I was searching for study partners in NYC and found that I relate with your goals. I want to find a study group in order to be more disciplined with how many hours I spend studying each week. I will take the GRE & GRE Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology and want to join other people not to actively study together at the same pace, but study at the same time in order to encourage each other. Do you already have a group? Are you interested in joining me?

Hi Gautam,

It’s Diane! I’m not sure if you changed your number again, but I texted you last week wishing you luck on the match! Hopefully you still get emails through studypal. I wanted to check in and see how everything went. I was thinking about you! I have faith that you did amazingly well, and I hope you matched at your first choice! I want to hear all about your experience on the interview trail and which specialty you ended up in. I am currently taking the Kaplan Step 2CK class to get this test out of the way, once and for all. I would love to touch base with you. Either send me an email (Diane.Lupovici@gmail.com) or a text (609-658-5732). 

Sincerely,
Diane

Hey Shaina,

How are you doing? Your name just popped up while I applied certain filters with regards to the Gmat examination which I guess both of us are aiming to give it by April 2016. 
Let me know if you are looking for a study pal for the preparation. Needless to say, I am actually looking for one, as that keeps up the momentum and pace of studies. 

I await for your response.

Are you preparing for CAT '17?
Hi, I am looking for a study partner preparing seriously for CAT 2017. Can we talk about it ?
Hey,

I just applied certain filters with regards to GMAT examination and your name popped up. Let me know if you are still looking for a study pal for the said exam. I would be appearing in March 2016. I am good with Quants, however my Verbal is pretty bad. Just saw that you have weakness in Quants segment. So in a way we can leverage upon each others strength. 

I await for your response.

Regards,
Vibhore

Hi, Joshua, 

I saw ur profile and wonder if  you want to study with me for the Feb exam. 
I am highly motivated!

I planned to take Dec exam, but found my prep score hasn’r reached to my goal. Which is over 165.  For recent two weeks, with strict timed diagnostic test, I got 160~164. I found it better to take Feb exam for better score. 

I’ve studied with a nice study-pal who I met through this web site. We have been good motivator to each other for 5 month, but the friend is taking some time off and resume study next year. So I am seeking a partner for the last 2 month till Feb exam. Yah…definitely much better to have some study together…

I am good with a weekend meeting and also I open to study through video chat(facetime/skype) when meeting is not available. (EX, I did a video chat during the week and a real meeting weekend with the friend. And it did work beautifully)

Please send me message or email.   byulyang@gmail.com
If you already doing team study, I would be more than happy to join there. 

Hi there.  I live in San Jose.  I am taking the MCAT summer of 2016 but am studying like I am taking it in January.  I study around 2-3 hours a day and am looking for a study partner to meet up with 2x a week.  Any interest in meeting up in Palo Alto once or twice a week?  If so, where are you at with your studying?  
Hi Rinka,

Are you studying for the GMAT? Are you still planning to take it in Sep?
Let me know if you'd like to connect and potentially set up some initial session(s) to study together. I just generally need a buddy to keep doing this regularly. I work at a 9-5 company though so I can only do evenings and weekends.

Cheers,
David

Dear Reader, 

Hi, my name is Jacob. I had some health related issues which forced me to delay my exam. As such, I am also taking my USMLE very soon. I study by myself a lot, but I also like to meet up and discuss the information surrounding the more difficult concepts. I was wondering if you would be interested in meeting for coffee sometime this week to see if we're compatible study partners. 
Thank you, 
Jacob 
Gul Gul, 
I was wondering if you're interested in meeting and having coffee and maybe studying a bit. The topic can be of your choice, but if I may suggest renal that is something that usually benefits from discussion. We can see if  we are effective study partners and go from there. Are you free any time this week? 
-Jacob 
Hi there! Are you still studying?

Hi Kareeba,

Are you still looking for a study partner? I'm really wanting to meet with someone to help me stay on target and vice versa. I typically work well when working with someone else. I currently  live in Capitol Hill near Union Station but can meet at a central location. I'm looking to really dig in beginning January and doing a strong three months of studying leading up to the April test date. 

Please let me know if you are interested in working together.

Best wishes,
Alexandria

Hey there, I am registered for Feb 6th but thinking definitely retaking in June. How do you feel about the upcoming test? Have you found a study partner yet? Amal
Hey there, I am registered for Feb 6th but thinking definitely retaking in June. My highest score so far is 155 but I just ordered Powerscore material and feel like I'm learning a ton with their method. Have you found a study partner yet? Amal
Hey there, I am registered for Feb 6th but thinking definitely retaking in June, possibly cancelling my Feb date. How has studying been for you? I wasted two months and too much money on a private tutor who had no real strategy. We just kept jumping around. It was demotivating and confusing. However, I just ordered the Logical Reasoning Bible from Powerscore and I love their method and style. I feel like I'm conceptualizing the test so much better already. Have you found a study partner yet? I'd love to talk more about possible collaboration. I've been reading lots about the test and a solid consistent study schedule can really push you over the edge in getting a high score. Amal

Hey Grace,

I'm taking the MCAT on April 23rd, and I'm trying to form some sort of community with whom I can take on this test. You're in Arlington, and that's super close. Do you known anyone else who is studying for the exam?

As of now, I'm planning on studying using a Kaplan set, TPRH, EK 1001's, and everything from the AAMC. 

A little about me: I graduated from UVa 2 years ago. I traveled around the world & worked in South Africa for a year (I didn't want to go straight into med school either). Now, I'm back home and am about to be studying for this class pretty much full time.

Ciao,
Emanuel

hey!! can you please clear my doubt?
Cost of debt is something(rate) by which company will have to pay to its investors right? 
But How can before tax cost of debt be greater than after tax cost of debt?
I mean tax on debt is being paid by the company right? so I guess after tax cost of debt should increase not decrease.

Hi are you appearing for FRM part 1 ?

Hi, have you started preparing for FRM part 1 already  ?
Hey Auburn! I checked out your profile and was wondering if you'd want to meet up and study/work on some problems? After looking through some profiles, yours seems to be most in line with mine.  Some more info about me- I graduated from Duke in December 2014 and majored in music.  I took most of my premed reqs at Duke, but I'm taking my last req this semester (physics II).  So I'm not sure how much help I'd be with physics, but maybe we could help each other through.  

Anyways, this studypal thing is new to me, but I figured I'd give it a go.  Let me know if you'd be interested in meeting up sometime.  Also, I spend a fair amount of time in Cary so I would be happy to meet at a coffee shop, library, etc somewhere around there.  

-Anna     
Hi there! I'm also studying for the MCAT, and I really need a buddy to help me stop procrastinating and get me on track. Hoping to surpass my previous self and to think positive!

Hi, are you preparing for step 1? Do you still need a study partner? I'm looking for someone to do Kaplan/Uworld questions with for 1-2 hrs daily. Please message me at yogituky@gmail.com if you're interested. Thanks.
Hi Anne,

Do you have any interest in being penpal study partners for the July 2017 bar exam?  My name is Sarah Appleton and I am in Memphis, Tennessee. I'm studying for the Tennessee bar while working. I have so far had no luck finding a study partner in the area whose study strategy works okay with mine. I can't afford a commercial course, and everyone else in my area seems to be using Barbri. I do want to follow a structured study plan like the one Barbri provides, but using my own materials. Let me know if you want to chat more.

Hi Shaina, I noticed you're scheduled to take the MCAT this summer. I'm planning on taking it around April/May. I recently graduated from Texas A&M with a biochemistry degree and will have the next couple of months to dedicate to studying. I don't know how much you've covered so far but it'd be nice to discuss some of these concepts with another. I'd be down to meet at a coffee shop or a library somewhere in Houston. 

Let me know your plans and if you wanna study. Thanks!

Hi Thais,
I saw that you are planning to take GRE in July. In my case, I just took it today but I am disappointed with my scores so I will need to hunch to this test again. So I was wondering if we could exchange ideas how to nail that 340 mark.
Hi Immanuel,
I saw that you are just starting prepping up for GRE. I was wondering if we could exchange ideas on how to nail that 340 grail.
Hi Sally,
I saw that you are planning to take GRE this Feb. I was wondering if we could help one another nailing the 340 grail.
Hi Roxanne,

I also live in the Mclean area and studying for the mcat in April 2016. I graduated from college in May and new to the area.  I have taken the mcat already once last April and think it would  be great to get a study buddy to work with maybe twice a week-- where we can go over material and also keep each other accountable to study and go through practice tests after we taken them. I know for me the hardest part is the confusing questions. Let me know-- there are also some great libraries around here-- dolly Madison is really cool and they have some great study rooms too! 
Hey hi.

Just wanted to introduce myself on here. My name is Raymond and I am located about 35 minutes west of Chicago in Streamwood. 

I am very excited to start studying for the PMP exam. I have an electronic version of the PMBOK 5th edition and Rita PMP Exam Prep 8th edition and have access for a few other books thru work. I am open to other books if a study partner strongly recommends one. 

I just started to study for the exam so I am looking for someone on the same level who has not started or just barely started studying for the exam. 

So far I have memorized the 47 Process Groups and Knowledge areas. If you need help in this area who has just started out, I can help and show what I have done so far to memorize this. 

My next plan is to read Rita's book one step at a time and memorize some of the important PMP calculations. I will admit I am not the best in Math so I will take time to learn these concepts. 

Please understand I have a full time job, pursing my master’s degree, and have a family of three kids. I am still very motivated to study and would like someone else that is equally passionate and motivated to study with. 

I do not have a set time or date in mind for the test. I hope within 6 to 8 months I can feel confident in taking the exam. I know the exam is going to change soon to the 6th edition so I will have to research when things change. I know there was a change already on the exam as of January 11th, 2016. 

If you are interested in forming a group please write back and let me know a little bit about yourself, your background, and your experience with PMP. 

I am looking for one or two people to form a group. We can meet on Google Hangouts and talk 2 to 3 scheduled nights a week. 

Thanks 

Raymond.

If you are interested in forming a group please write back and let me know a little bit about yourself, your background, and your experience with PMP. 

I am looking for one or two people to form a group. We can meet on Google Hangouts and talk 2 to 3 scheduled nights a week. 

Thanks

hi...even I am appearing for ct exams
Just wanted to introduce myself on here. My name is Raymond and I am located about 35 minutes west of Chicago in Streamwood. 

I am very excited to start studying for the PMP exam. I have an electronic version of the PMBOK 5th edition and Rita PMP Exam Prep 8th edition and have access for a few other books thru work. I am open to other books if a study partner strongly recommends one. 

I just started to study for the exam so I am looking for someone on the same level who has not started or just barely started studying for the exam. 

So far I have memorized the 47 Process Groups and Knowledge areas. If you need help in this area who has just started out, I can help and show what I have done so far to memorize this. 

My next plan is to read Rita's book one step at a time and memorize some of the important PMP calculations. I will admit I am not the best in Math so I will take time to learn these concepts. 

Please understand I have a full time job, pursing my master’s degree, and have a family of three kids. I am still very motivated to study and would like someone else that is equally passionate and motivated to study with.

Hi Katherine, How are you doing? I'm also studying for the MCAT, and have been out of school for about a year and a half.

Anyway, if you ever want to meet up to study together or chat about the test let me know. Or if you ever want to shoot me a message about anything I would just love to study or just talk about the test. -Angela

Hey i am also preparing for FRM we could share notes and ideas 




Hi Gaurav.
I am Palak. I just completed Masters in Economics from National University of Singapore (NUS). I want to start my career in risk management and I feel FRM would be apt to gain the necessary skills and competencies required. I have not started preparing for it and I am not sure whether 4 months are enough for the preparation. I do not have a strong quant background. Can please give your insights as to how should I go about it? Do you believe in self study or are you taking classes like edupristine or online courses? Do you use bionic turtle and/or schweser?
Thank you for your help.

Hello, 
I decided to try CFA level 1 in December 2016,
good luck in June for you
and hope you will pass it
if not we can study together in automn 2016 !
Ludivine
If you are looking for someone to bounce ideas off ; send me a message.
Hi Song Jie,

I've just signed-up, and wondered if you'd be interested in studying together for the CFA level II (and potentially forming a mini-study group)?

I've just got my CFA I result, and figured finding a study-partner could help get through all the material that needs to be covered, whilst avoiding the traps of tedium (and wasted time) when studying in isolation. 

By background, I've worked in finance for 10 years (IBD and M&A), have a girlfriend, and am originally from the UK (though until recently, was living in SE Asia). Though the CFA isn't critical to my career, I think it's a useful tool to gain perspective within finance.

If our motivations are similar, then perhaps we can see if there are ways we can work together?

Whatever happens, good luck in June!
Karim
Hi Wei. I just saw your profile on StudyPal and am looking for someone to study with for the Level 3 CFA exam coming June. In particular, I think it would be useful to meet and do practice questions together (i.e. cross-checking each other's responses and grading the other's answers as if it would be the real exam, based on the standard answers given). If this is something you think would be useful too (and I am open to what other methods you suggest), then maybe we can get in touch? Best regards, Stephan
Hey - I also just starting studying for Level 1.  Would you wanna try to get a group or meet up to study? I work full-time so usually only study at night or on the weekend.  Also, one of my other friends is taking level 1 in June, so I'm sure he would want to study with other people as well.  Let me know if you're interested.  Here is my linkedin:

I have the latest version of the PMBOK Guide and Rita's newest study manual. 

If interested please respond with your best available times and if you're flexible or not, your study materials. I'd like to start nest week. I'm sure we all contribute something for the other to be successful on the exam. So lets do this!

Hi there!!! Me too studying for cet (March). Have you given any other exams? :)
Hi Haleem, 
how are you? How is the study going? I hope it is ok that i am messaging you. My name is Jennifer and i have just scheduled my exam for the end of April. I have been working as a junior PM for about 3 years and have enough hours and experience to sit the exam. I have bought the books and am just getting a bit overwhelmed as to where to start. I have the PMBOK and also Rita Mulchays book. I have looked up forums and am trying to see what the best approach is. I don't want to waste time. How did you approach the exam? The PMBOK is so big and i see that people say they have read it 2 or 3 times and then Ritas book. Is that what you would recommend? I don't have time to attend a class room course at the moment so are there any online courses that you joined? any help at all would be so appreciated. I hope i am not interrupting your study,
kind regards
Jen

Please message me anytime my email is cheisvangordon87@gmail.com. it's my husband's email but I use it. Maraming Salamat po, God bless

Hello,
I just wanted to introduce myself on here. My name is Manohara and I am located about 35 miles north of Chicago 
I am very excited to start studying for the PMP exam so I am looking for someone on the same level who has not started or just barely started studying for the exam.
I do not have a set time or date in mind for the test. I hope within 6 to 8 months I can feel confident in taking the exam. I know the exam is going to change soon to the 6th edition so I will have to research when things change. I know there was a change already on the exam as of January 11th, 2016. 
If you are interested please write back 
Thanks 
Manohar

Hi Ali,

I am doing the level 1 in June as well and I am on my final topic test (economics) which I expect to be done my end of this month. A little bit about my background, majored in financial mathematics attended Dalhousie in Halifax NS.

I have been studying for quite some time now and I would really appreciate a study buddy especially the last two months before the exam where we can do exam problems via skype and just motivate each and bring the best out of each so we can clear the exam come June.

If that is sometime you will be into and would enjoy the preparation challenge for the June exam just give me a shout back and we can coordinate our preparation and motivate each other.

Thanks,
Joe

Hello Kevin,

This is Bryant Nguyen. I graduated from UC Irvine with a B.S in Biology. I am planning to take MCAT in the spring 2017 and looking for a study buddy in Orange County, CA. I want to give you a quick introduction about me. This will be my second time taking the MCAT. I took the old MCAT in January 2015 and I have been studying for the new MCAT for over a year since last summer 2015.

My study strategy is to go over my weaknesses which are mostly physics and verbal reasoning and take a practice test every weekend three months before the real MCAT and go over the exam the next two three days. I also review psychology and sociology section by using Khan Academy every week, because I heard people are also struggled with this section on the real MCAT. I saw that your strengths are chemistry and physics so you can help me with physics and I can help you with biology. Like you said that we do not have to go at the same pace. I study mostly at Chapman University library and sometimes Cerritos library.

If you want to meet up, we can meet at Cerritos library next week. I can meet with you next Monday or Wednesday afternoon at Cerritos library or let me know what time will work for you next week? Please email to let me know.

Best regards,



Bryant Nguyen

Hello Kristin,

I know this is not Facebook, so you probably will get my message when it's too late!

I -too- am studying for CPA, my next two exams are FAR on April, and planning AUD on May 31 !!   it's too strict and very focused and study at night, sleep in the afternoon after work.

I finish work around 5:00 pm.. go home have quick lunch and go to sleep..
I normally wake up after 12 to start studying for around 5 hours.. then sleep again for an hour or two before work 

I hope this suits your studying style and continue together on this

cuz I do nothing without having a partner to motivate each others, and I was so much of my valuable limited time.

Hope you respond to this in time so we can work together

Yours, 
Moda

Hello Emma, this is Seyma from Turkey.I am preparing oh no! I am struggling for Toefl. I want to apply master degree programs in America. I am living here for 6 month. I came here because I married with my husband at summer in 2015. I take my first Toefl in this month and my score is 66. I felt sad of course because I need more for master acceptance. That is all I have. May be we can talk each other and by this way we can improve our skills, have good day :)

Hi Nilesh! I am just starting with prep for CFA level 1, we can start the prep  together if you are comfortable.


Hello Miss.Akshara,

Hope you are doing great! I'm a Cat 2016 aspirant and coming in personal,I'm a working professional.I'm okay for preparing in the nights and early in the morning as I need to go to my work in the day time.I'm good at basics and planning things and very patient.There's reason for selecting a person in the opposite gender.It gives a good spirit in learning things much better. Hope you do accept my invitation and let's mutually help each other in learning things and crack CAT2016.

Very Best,
Siddhartha

Hi, 

My name is Mang. I am taking the MCAT on Mat 6, 2016 and I'm looking for a study partner. I am a UMD alumni, but I am currently living in Baltimore. I am doing content review using Kaplan and EK materials. I hope to be done with content review mid-March and then start working on Full Length Practice exams all throughout April. I was hoping to find a study partner that would take the exams with me, and then go over answers together. Since we do a bit far from each other we could just do skype sessions. I always think it's beneficial to have someone else correct you/teach other concepts you're familiar with.

Let me know if this is something you'd like to do or if you have any questions for me. 

Thanks, 

Mang

hello, Sanchita here. 
Can we team up and study for MBA entrance together? 
I see our preferences are alike.
I am completely new to this site, hence unaware of how it works.
It will be great if we start off with the prep at the earliest! 

Regards.

Hi, 

I came across your profile out of the whole lot and frankly found a parallel inclination towards CAT '16!

Although I was discouraged at first, since both of our weaknesses were the same then again maybe in this way we could motivate and propel each other towards making amendments.

I signed up on StudyPal tonight and i probably wont be visiting it any time soon. Hence I'll leave ways to get in touch below :  

E-mail : mrinmay93@gmail.com
WA: 8130021800

About my background I'm a dual degree holder (B.Tech/M.Tech) slated to pass out this year 
(well hopefully!). So this year is my penultimate chance at give it a go!

Alright there you go, make your mind up!



P.S. Only contact if you're absolutely sincere about CAT! (No ifs/buts)
Hi, 

I came across your profile out of the whole lot and frankly found a parallel inclination towards CAT '16!

Hi, Swarna!  Are you still looking for a study buddy?  I'm planning to take the exam sometime this summer, and I could definitely benefit from some accountability.  I notice that you prefer to study in the mornings and afternoons. . .  Were you looking for a study partner to meet in person, or someone to hold you accountable and work through questions together?  I've taken the GMAT before (640, eh) and I need a really high score to be competitive.  Let me know if you're interested and what you're looking for in a study partner.  Thanks!  Jamie
I'm going to be taking the exam in May. I'm still debating
the 5th or 20th
Are you still looking to study with someone?

Hi Wendi, I am Pu. I live near IUPUI campus and usually study there. I am preparing for step 1 now, but I am not a medical student.

Hi Irma,

I joined the Study Pal and you were the first profile with actual picture, yeah!

Hi Nancey, I also applied to CBS. If you have not heard of it yet Magoosh is a great prep resource. It has videos covering every section of the exam both Quant and Verbal, and also has practice questions/tests. They usually run discounts on it from time to time. I got the premium version for $99, and it lasts for a year. If you want to study over Skype let me know. I am pretty strong on Quant.

Hello,
Have you already taken any parts of the exam or are you still searching for a study partner?

Best regards,

Hi Lori, I not sure if you already took GMAT or not. If possible, I want to study with, because both of us are looking for 700+ and top MBA. Moreover, you say you good at verbal but not so good at math. I got 51 in GMAT before, but I got poor point in verbal, so I think maybe we can work together and help each other. Looking for your reply. Thanks

Without job, it is hard to pay 40$/hr, so please kindly let me know your   price. One of main reasons I failed few times was not able to get extra time for step 3 although I have well documented learning disabilities  (dyslexia and ADHD), I hope I will be able to get this time , but I need someone  to keep me sharp as studying for this exam again is painful, I will have quite bit to enhance your knowledge with my experience as well. Please email me at milindnjoshi@gmail.com 

Thank you 
Sincerely

I have done U world Q bank for step 3 at least twice. so I deliberately signed up step 2 CK Q bank to have different questions, and practice, which may work well for you .  Please let me know if you have taken step 3. Also, since I am currently not working, the price is on little higher side, please let me know if you have any discounted price. 
Thank you

Hi Glenda,

Are you looking for a study buddy in person or via Skype?

I'm finishing my second year now and thought it would be nice to find someone not in my class to study with... would probably help avoid distractions.

Hi Lara,

I am just starting my prep for GMAT and my biggest challenge is to keep up the motivation for the entire duration of preparation so I was looking for some study pal to keep the momentum going. I noticed that our areas of strength compliment each other. I am not entirely sure if you are still looking for a study pal and if logistically we can be co located for group studies but it's worth checking. Let me know if you are interested in group studies once or twice a week. Best of luck with your prep.

Cheers,
Harmeet
Hey buddy, just noticed we have similar interest. Just starting with my prep for GMAT, kind of hard to keep up the motivation for the entire duration. Let me know if you want to collaborate during the prep. Since we are not co located we can maybe share notes or discuss the strategies.

Cheers,
Harmeet
Hi Kavita,

I hope you're well. I am just starting with my GMAT prep and it's kind of hard to keep the momentum going for then entire duration of prep especially with a full time job. I am looking for a study partner to occasionally share the strategies, discuss weak points and also to keep up the motivation. We are not co located geographically so we have to do it offline most of the time. Let me know if you are interested. Best of luck with your prep.

Cheers,
Harmeet

Hello Raymond. how are you doing. I see you are studying for the PMP and I wanted to see if you wanted to study together. I see you are  located in Chicago. I am located in Indiana currently. I plan to try to sit for the PMP in July. Our situation is very similar. I am also married with two children, work full time, working on my Masters and I am studying for the PMP. I have actually started my studies in January. I am using both the PMBOK and Rita for my studies. I will like to ready the Rita book from Cover to Cover by the end of May.

I have added you on Skype. If we can talk there and come up with a study plan that would be great. 

My goal is to pass the exam on the first attempt.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks

Hello again Lissette I was doing some research and it looks like a good study plan for the LSAT is about 4 mo.  I've been studying for a month and therefore only have two mo left to study.  I'm willing to put on as many hours as it takes to get a high score.  I'm enrolled in the Kaplan course and have all the books and online access.  If you would like to Skype or FaceTime on the phone to meet my phone number is 305-297-2547. You can reach me there at anytime.  Also,  I live in Coral Gables but I can travel to a library or coffee shop

Hi Avni!

I'm messaging to see if you would interested in being study partners. I started studying for the GMAT a few weeks ago and I'm currently I'm enrolled in the Live Manhattan Prep course on Monday evenings. I'll also most likely do private tutoring for about 6 weeks after the course ends.

It seems your exam is a bit further out than mine so I'm not sure how tedious your studying routine is at this point. However, if you're serious about studying, let me know if being studying pals would be of interest.

Feel free to message back here or via email at nicholas.a.thomas.250@gmail.com. 

Have a great day!

Nicholas

Hello Mohammed,

Are you still looking for a study partner for the USMLE Step 1? I currently am and wanted to let you know a little more than a profile explanation of myself.  I am a student who loves to learn and loves to teach, especially about medicine. I always have applied myself fully in medical school however the step 1 process can be very lonely and motivation fluctuates. It would be great to go through it with someone else conquering the monster together. Let me know if you are interested. My number is 818-984-9562, you can text me there for a much faster response time. Looking forward to speak!

I am halfway through the books but just starting out on the CARS
I've taken only 1 full length but haven't reviewed it yet 
How would you like to do this? 
I was thinking about adding you on skype and we can talk once 
Every few days to decide what we'll study and we make sure to 
Cover it 
Ok I added you on Skype. For Kaplan course it's okay I didn't
Learn a lot from them but I had a full load and a really busy
Semester. I am studying the books and do study guides for 
Harder concepts as I go 
How are you doing on the CARS section?

Hi Ray. My name is Rie.I'm from Japan and currently live in Burnaby. I'm looking for a friend who can study with me sometimes.Actually,I study for USCPA exams. I know that you are studying for LSAT, but it would be nice if you could study with me at a cafe or a library sometimes.I don't have any friends who study accounting or study for exams and am looking for someone who has a goal and has been making efforts for it. It would be very nice to have such a positive and motivated friend.I'm sorry about my English, since English is not my first language. If you are interested, please let me know. Happy Canada Day!

Hi Mazen

Please contact me via skype, "Milindnjoshi"  or preferably via email @milindnjoshi@gmail.com

HI 
I needed tutoring for USMLE. I actually have mainly problem with finishing exam on time parially due to my learning disbaility . so I needed a tutor to time me while I do question. 
Also, we can briefly go over quickly concepts of questions if you feel I am missing the knowledge. But I feel my knowledge is not my weakness. 

I can explain more once we chat. my email is milindnjoshi@gmail.com and Skype ID milindnjoshi. Please let me know if you are available. My timings are quite flexible. I am from Atlanta. 
Thank you
sincerely

Hey. Saw your profile. For Logic Reasoning, try a "skipping" method. If it takes you longer than a minute to grasp the concept/relationship then skip that question and come back.

This helps you become more accurate rather than going through all the questions. For example if it's the 5 minute warning and question 19 is taking you too long, you wouldn't know if the last 3 were easy or not. the last 3 could have been 3 you got right but you'd never know because 19 was difficult and took your time. The test makers know this.

Anyway. Good Fortune

Hi:

My name is Tyricka and I see that you are studying for the upcoming LSAT. I took the exam in June and was 5 points away from my desired score. I have decied to go back at it again to see if my score will increase. In my preparation I decided it may be better if I could find a study partner that is as equally dedicated to the exam as much as I am. I would like to have someone to study with maybe 3-4xs  a week. Be it skype or facetime. If you would like to study together please let me know. My schedule is open at the moment as I am out of work. 

Hope to speak with you soon!

I have decied to go back at it again to see if my score will increase. In my preparation I decided it may be better if I could find a study partner that is as equally dedicated to the exam as much as I am. I would like to have someone to study with maybe 3-4xs  a week. Be it skype or facetime. If you would like to study together please let me know. My schedule is open at the moment as I am out of work. 

Hope to speak with you soon!

Sincerely,

Tyricka S.

Hi Julie,

My name is Nady and I am looking for a study partner to take the GRE.  I am serious with my study habits, I have taken an official GRE prep class and I wanted to know if you are interested in being a study partner.

Many thanks!

Hi Toni! Sorry I missed your message. I'm currently working at Step 2 CK, but am west of the city - if you are looking for a 2 ck studier and like my profile/study habits, definitely message me back!

Hey Syed, Are you studying for step 1 or 2? 
I'm looking for a step 2 ck study 'partner', someone to keep company and keep each other on track, as well as discuss any topics/concepts. I have a vehicle, and am just west of the city. I often study at libraries or coffee shops.
If you're going for CK and looking for a study partner, let me know!

Hi Oliver,

I'm also trying to study for the 2017 Jan MCAT! How do you feel?

I graduated from college two years ago and started working, and I definitely have to pick it back up. My background content knowledge is weak, but I'm eager to put in work and get a great, competitive score. 

Let me know if you'd like to meet up! 
Hey Maria!
I'm in Houston, and am wanting to take the MCAT on Jan 2017. I graduated from college in 2014, and have been working since. The MCAT has been so overwhelming for me because I have a weak grasp of content knowledge. However, I do feel like I could benefit from studying with a partner, and going through problem sets and passages! Let me know if you're interested! I really wanted to excel! 

Let me know your thoughts! 
Yes

I was planning to take the test in January 2017. I am looking for a study partner locally. I live probably an hour away from you in Michigan. But still would like to have a study pal. Since I get lazy on my own. Please let me know, and if you are in Skype: please add me: mddreams

Hope to talk to you soon.

Cheers,
Sam

Hi Eileen,

I've recently started studying to take the MCAT next spring.  As a non-traditional student (2009 grad), I've been struggling to find study partners in the area.  I came across this site and noticed you were aiming for a similar date.  Would you have any interest in meeting up to discuss goals and a study plan to see if we might be able to work together?

Best,

Chris

Hope you do accept my invitation and let's mutually help each other in learning things and crack CAT2016. Cheers!!

Hello Jilberto. 
I just saw your profile on StudyPal.coom. I'm sorry if I'm bothering you with my request. I wanted to learn how was your experience when applying at Foster. I'm a Latino immigrant working for a travel agency. I don't know if I have a shot at Foster. I haven't taken my GMAT yet. 
I know this is pretty random and that you probably don't want to waste your time replying. I'm just a bit desperate for information. All the research I do, people tend to tell me what's "politically correct" but the real honest opinion is hard to get. 

Thank you in advance if you take some time to reply. 

All the best Jilberto. 
Hi Veronica!

I started studying for PMP too and I wonder if you would like to meet and study, show each other how to improve our scores if possible. And of course motivation/accountability.

Hi, my name is Eduardo and was wondering if you'd be interested in forming a study group. I find that other people can always bring in useful perspectives regardless of how well my understanding of the subject matter is. I hope that we can work something out and get a study group started.

i am an img from india. let me know if you are interested in discussing any subject.
Dear Daniel,

My name is Yana. I recently moved back to Moscow, but if you are able to study on Skype together, I would be more than happy to keep you company. I'm planing to pass the exam on November and feel more comfortable with Verbal rather than Math. Thus, maybe we would be able to somehow help each other. 

Add me on Skype if you wish - YD M

Regards,
Yana
Dear Alvin,

My name is Yana. I am preparing for the CFA level 1, my big day is in December. I study by Wiley. If you could coach me on formulas and material in general at least twice a week in Skype, I would feel more confident. My biggest concern for now is Ethics. Would appreciate to hear from you any time soon. 

Regards, 
Yana

I am and IMG 
Dude been studying since January, I take NBME every month. 
Pathoma FA and Uworld 
All my mates did the same and got good scores 
Practice as much.. 
Study a lot, everyday 6 days a week and try to connect the dots 
There is no other way, you have to understand everything and 
Memorize as much as u can. Do questions everyday. 
All American students now study these 3 things as well. 
All American students now study these 3 things as well. 
If so.. Can you tell me about your studying strategy?
All American students now study these 3 things as well. 
That's pretty much what I've been doing lately.. Or atleast
Plan on doing. These days doing Pathoma 
I started with Kaplan 
Physio and Biochem
After that I started Pathoma
And after this I'll be doing Micro and then Pharm. 
Yeah pathoma is key. And read a lot of first aid 
Physio and biochem are enough from FA and questions 
Then at first FA With UsmleRX 
Then FA and uworld
Micro is enough from FA and questions. I don't see anything else
Good luck.. That will take a while 
Took me almost a year and I'm not done yet
But to get good score I have to do this.. 
I honestly think I wasted a lot of time on Kaplan.. But I was
I started in august
But to get good score I have to do this.. 
So in your opinion nothing is out of these 3 resources that 
Everyone i see at temple med studies pathoma and FA with uW
You've mentioned 
So that Gave me confidence about my prep 
Been sticking to that and it helps, my scores are ok
But there study style is much different then us during med schoo
Started at about 40% on Uworld now at 65-70

Hi, I passed step1&CS and am now preparing for step2 CK. I mainly study with FA and added some info from Kaplan and step up to medicine. I am also targeting for March, 2017. If you are interested, please send a message or mail me to argent11@naver.com

Yunjeong from Korea.
If you are preparing for another step, you can just ask me anything about either step 1 or 2CS or any other things e.g. USCE. One of the main reason I joined this site is that finding someone to exchange the information is way harder than I expected. Thanks. 
Hey, Im also studying for USMLE Exam, let me know if you like to REVIEW FirstAid book together. Please email me and we can discuss further info. thanks

Hello Alekhya

I am looking for a partner or possibly a group to study for the GMAT. Would you be interested in preparing with me? Or if you have a study group already, could I join?

I am planning on using Magoosh and the official curriculum.

I work as a quant-trader at a leading proprietary trading firm in the Chicago Loop area.


Thanks,

Gary
Hi Christine,

Hello my name is LaWanda and like you I'm dealing with anxiety about the quantitative reasoning section as well. I need at least a 155 or greater on that section and a 305-310 overall score in order to be considered competitive. Therefore whenever you get a moment please email me at mlawanda@live.com so that we can figure out if we are a good match.

I look forward to hear from you & Happy Thanksgiving!

Hi Andrea, I am also studying for the February exam, and find studying alone isolating and unproductive. I am an interactive learner and would benefit from talking through things and studying with a partner. I have taken and passed the MA bar exam, so I kind of know what one is like- but nervous about TX. Would you be interested in FaceTiming flashcards or Skyping to go over things together?

Hello, I'm also just starting to prepare for the USMLE step 1 to give early next year. I was wondering if you would be interested in setting up a group or something similar to help us both out. I'm in Sacramento, California, so I doubt traditional means would work, but maybe something like Skype etc could work?
Looking for a study partner. Based in Mumbai. And the exam is a month earlier.

Hi Surabhi... This is Lavanya.. I am currently living in Austin and pursuing CPA .. I came across your account while searching for a study buddy.. Do let me know if you wish to study together ..

But ya we can keep in touch and motivate and each other .. Do let me know either ways ?
I did pass my exam

Hello Jackie,

I am planning to take CFA Level II this June and just starting to study. It would be nice to have someone targeting in the same direction. Let me know if you're interested. We can meet in person or online once a week to discuss how much we finished. I understand the time is short and I'm working too, so studying could be challenging but I believe anything is possible if tried.

Hi Nissa, I am also studying for the February exam, and find studying alone isolating and unproductive. I am an interactive learner and would benefit from talking through things and studying with a partner. I have taken and passed the MA bar exam, so I kind of know what one is like- but now taking TX. Wondering if you would want to work through MBE stuff together? Would you be interested in FaceTiming flashcards or Skyping to go over things together?
If you are interested - and want to text or email my phone # is 713-320-2934 and aadam2934@gmail.com. It may be easier than trying to coordinate here. 
Hi Sam, Hope your studying is going well. This is my second exam ( TX) and I passed the MA Bar already. I graduated Suffolk Law School in Boston in May 2016.  I would be interested in talking some stuff through with a buddy to review. My email is aadam2934@gmail.com, and my number is 713-320-2934. Feel free to reach out if you want to meet up on FaceTime/Skype some study sessions. Best, A
Hi Aly- Would you be interested in Facetiming or Skyping to study together/review some of the MBE portion of the exam? My schedule is flexible. Feel free to reach out by email or text/call. 713.320.2934, aadam2934@gmail.com
Hi Amanda, would love to. My cell 6199876542 lets facetime

hey Safia, i noticed you viewed my profile. I have a subscription to the USMLE rx questions, and i was looking for someone to do them together through screen-share on skype. Basically, you would see my screen and we would brainstorm the questions together. This method allows for increased motivation for both of us and will help us remember the details. If anything, if you want, we can give it a shot, for a couple questions. If you like it, and think its beneficial, we can continue, if not, then you can do your own thing. Please let me know. thanks.

hi. Would you be interested in studying on skype?

Please let me know if you're interested. My email is omario@omario.com and my mobile is 310-993-9503. Thank you! No worries if it's not your style - just reaching out to as many people as I can.

Please let me know if you're interested. My email is omario@omario.com and my mobile is 310-993-9503. Thank you! No worries if it's not your style - just reaching out to as many people as I can. Thank you! Omario

Hi Kevin, how's your studying going? I was wondering if you wanted to study together for part 2 if you're in the downtown area sometime. Just for moral support!
hey..
Hi, I was looking to find a study partner just for moral support. Let me know if you would be interested in studying together somewhere downtown like a library or a coffee shop on an evening or weekend sometime. I am studying for the FRM which is in May, but just thought it would be helpful to study with other people.

My old score is just over 5 years old, and isn’t valid..  I’m a 700 scorer who is taking the test again soon…  And I’m looking to improve on my last best effort, as I know now that I could have done much better on the Verbal and the Quant sections…I have a familiarity with the test and I’ve been studying for a couple months…   I hope to help others while I finish maxing out my study prep…   We can work over skype or google hangouts…

Hey,

I'm currently working full time and preparing for GMAT. I'm planning to take the exam in about 3-4 months. If you're preparing, would you be interesting in forming a study group? My strength is Quant, but I'm not terrible at verbal either. If you're interested, let me know, or you can ping me on my email.

Hey 
Im also preparing for CAT!!!
Shall we be study partners??

Did you place in the 90% on LSAT? I  would like to learn strong study techniques.I'm certain my study techniques have plenty of room for improvement.I went through Kaplan last year to study, there were far too may issues with getting correct materials. I tend to be multi sensory learner. I would love to set up time to meet next week and get at least 1.5 hrs in of tutoring.
I also wanted to know if your currently in study group or forming one. I will be leaving on the 7th to go see my daughter, which was planned out several months ago. I really think it would be beneficial to be in study group at least 4 days a week. I want to get at 35 hours of study time per week. Plz let me know your thoughts, feedback etc. 
Thanks in advance,

Marcia

Hi there,

I just joined study pal so I am not really sure how it works. I am assuming we can just message other members to see if they are interested in meeting up to study. I am also writing in June 2017. I had started studying earlier this year but then went on hiatus. I would like to get back into it at full force. I am wondering if you would like to meet up to study sometime or if you wouldn't mind sharing some study locations you may know about around the city. 

Thanks.

Hi Vijay,

Hope this email finds you well.  You came up on my search of people near me who are studying for the GMAT and so I wanted to get in touch about studying together.  I am also planning to take the GMAT in September and live in the Plainsboro area. A little background -- I took the GMAT once earlier this summer without much targeted practice and got a 710, but am looking to crack 740+.  I'm pretty strong in RC and want to focus more on improving Quant. I can be reached at shrinidhibalu90@gmail.com -- let me know and hope the studying has been going well so far!

Best,
Shrinidhi
Hi Sujata,

Hope the studying is going well so far!

Best,

Please let me know if you'd be open to studying with me or have any questions about me :)

Hi Michelle - I just found your profile and we seem to have a lot in common. I live in Phoenix and work at a private practice 2-3 times a week.  I am studying for my second attempt at the EPPP.  I've mainly been using the PsychPrep materials as well.  I'd like to take it in October but am having the hardest time staying motivated studying by myself.  I'm wondering if you would be interested in studying together sometime.  My email is christina.mcshane@gmail.com if you'd rather communicate directly.   Thanks! Christina

Hi there,
I'm Natali and just got on this website because I am looking for a study partner! 
Basically, I've been studying for the Step 1 exam since May and have the big day in October. It's hard to study by yourself for months at a time, so I'm looking for someone that would be up for skyping or facetiming and reviewing questions/concepts/UWorld diagrams/FA notes etc. I believe even talking over answer choices and why we each choose one etc helps in learning. I live in Miami so I think skype/facetime would be best. 
I don't work right now so I'm really flexible in times to study, my resources are UWorld, First Aid and Pathoma (plus some anatomy books because that's my weakness).
Please let me know if you'd be open to studying with me or have any questions about me :)
Thanks!

Hello Ronnie, 
I'm not sure if you are still active on this site. How is your LSAT prep going? I'm still studying hard. I usually try to study at Sac State library since it's open so late. If you would like to share study strategies or just talk about the LSAT in general let me know. I'm extremely hard working and I assure you I take this seriously and won't waste your time. 

Good Luck, 
Aaron

Hi David,

I am studying for the LSAT, and I plan on taking it in February 2018. I think we have similar goals. I tend to slack if I am left on my own, but if I have someone holding me accountable I will always show up and work hard. 

My plan is to study around 25-28 hours per week, starting the week of September 17. I am taking an LSAT course through PowerScore beginning then. Manhattan coffee shops are perfect for me, preferably the midtown area. 

Please let me know if this could be a fit for you. 
anjana u wish to do combine study??
would you want to join a study group? We can teach each other things and be a source of encouragement. 
Hey! I see you're also studying for the LSAT. would you be interested in forming a study group?

Yes for June 2018
I just started with the financial reporting
what about you
Great. So are u preparing from Schweser?
till now I have gone through the Cfa official books
and I have thinking of purchasing the schweser also
Okay. I have also started with the FRA
and i have been looking for a way to get schweser
from schweser
or from the official books
yea I am also looking for that one
from the official. I haven't yet got the schweser
I have ordered them but not yet received
so how you are planning to get the schweser
There is some problem from the courier side.
I might receive them in a week maybe
oh ok so you have already ordered
Yeah..from some bookstore in mumbai
great and are you taking any coaching
I'll go through the Mark Meldrum videos.
how much did it cost you
I don't think coaching would add any great value
the books
I am also going through mark videos

Hey. was wondering if you are still available to study. I see that your strength is in reading comprehension. Perhaps it would be of help to you to study with someone such as myself who has somewhat of a weakness in this area. I'm not sure if you need much focus on the quantitative reasoning section the way I do. Let me know. Thanks
Are you by any chance still looking for a study partner?
Oh I am still a student currently, so I cannot promise the hours
that I can study, but we may have a weekly meeting to discuss
our questions
Can we contact via email ? ellenqi@umich.edu

Hello Molly,

I registered for CFA Level II as well. I am starting to study and would be great to have a study partner. 

I had a study partner for  Level I and had good learning experience there but she is not pursuing Level II. So seeking a new partner or group.

We can schedule study plan and can meet up once a week or whenever is convenient to discuss what we studied, any problems faced and keep each other's progress on track.

Please let me know if you are interested. Thank you for reading.

Cheers,

Hasibur

Its quite boring going through it on one's own and it helps to keep up ones motivation when two people go through. Let me know your thoughts. Thanks.

Hi there,
Im looking for a study partner...ive done 1st read of FA and did uworld here and there...would love to have a study partner to help get through this. Thought i will be fine alone but i need some motivation. I know we might be in different places in our studying. but would you still be down to study together but separately? Like you can do your thing, i can do my schedule. But we study together maybe in library or something and we can have a proper structure...time schedule and everything? we can keep each other motivated and on track? Its ok if your not interested just throwing out an idea since we are both from michigan. I live in novi..and i wouldnt mind driving a little bit. We can study at a library or something? i just need a structure...studying at home by myself im getting lazy and unmotivated some days so tryna get on top of that. A little information about me im Smanvi. I went to a Caribbean med school. Im indian, born in Hyderabad but grew up in Canada. 
Let me know if you would be interested :)

Hello Caroline, 
I'm looking for a colleague to study with. Unfortunately, math is not my strength, but I think it would help to brainstorm ways to solve problems together. I'm at a stage where I'm interested in different approaches to solve the same problem. 
Let me know. I'm in Bellevue
