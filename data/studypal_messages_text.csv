Hello! I am also studying for the july MCAT and was wondering if you would want to mostly silent skype study together? I think having someone that is studying day and night for the same test as you is really motivating so you are more effective and take less breaks. I'd be down to go over concepts at the end of the week as well, and review/share what we both studied. I am currently enrolled in a Kaplan course, and want someone else to study with! Let me know if you would be interested in studying together! E-mail me at: swati.samtani@gmail.com

so it looks like you are the only one who is from the Baltimore area and scheduled to take the October exam.
Let me know if you are interested in reviewing a few times as needed only after establishing exactly what one needs to work on; my strength are in RC and avg on LG; LR is something I am striving to improve the most, with my goal score being 165+; as mentioned in my status update, I have access to UMBC and therefore often study at their campus library-which can be a convenient study session; they even have a 24hr study lounge.

With best regards,
Daniel

Hello, assuming you're still studying for the GMAT I live and work inside the 610 loop in Houston. Let me know if you're interested in getting together to study. Just having someone there that is going through this is great motivation for me.  I am flexible to study anytime however my preferred time is early morning, after work > 5pm, or weekend.

Dear Syed,
How are you doing? I noticed that you are interested to take the GRE test. I am, as well, planning to take the test in December and willing for a big score. Do you mind if we get to know each other and keep in touch regarding progress in studying? I am from Sudan, living in Emirates at the moment and I am that kind of ppl getting bored quickly from study routine. Moreover, no one of my friends is taking the test. If you are interested, we can share study experience. I hope I hear from you soon. Good Luck!

Hi,
I am also preparing for GRE. Would you like to join with me to study?
Hi, I'm new to this service but just saw that you're in the Boston area and studying for a November date. 

I work in the financial district (near S. Station), and am mainly looking for someone to compare notes with about resources and study techniques

I am currently working with an older set of Manhatten prep books given to me by a friend who's already taken the GMAT.  I also have the official guide.

Much of my prep work has been focused on math (my lowest score on the practice/diagnostic test).   If you need help with Verbal, that's my strong suit.

Thanks and looking forward to hearing from you
Hi Moyukh, 

 I am looking for serious study pals in melb for gmat. let me know if you are interest.3

Dear Mitul,
I am planning to sit for the GRE in early December. I am preparing from several sources however I need guidance for ultimate progress. Math part is ok for me compared to verbal section, however, I am aiming to master both. My goal is to apply for PhD scholarship in US. Therefore, I really need to get to a high score. I appreciate if you could help me with tips and best study plan. At the moment I am in United Arab Emirates, so tutoring will be online. I appreciate if you could help me with my studies. If it is ok with you, we can further discuss on tutoring plan and fees.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Hi
Hello Rohit,

How are you doing?
Hey, I've just started studying for the June 2014 LSAT as well.  Study partners are pretty scarce considering none of my friends want to go to law school, and not many people start preparing this early.  I have the Powerscore Logic games, Manhattan LG,LR, RC books, as well as Master the LSAT by Nova.  The beginning of LSAT study typically involves just reading/drilling through the prep books, so it may be a good idea to share resources if you're interested in that as well.  Let me know if you'd like to start studying anytime.  I'm currently taking classes, but I'd be available weekdays after 1 on Tue,Thur.  And Anytime on MWF.  I have class until 1 pm. on Saturday ,but asides from that I'll be available on weekends.

Hello CFA hopeful. I live in Orange County, and will likely take Level 1 in June. Just did the December Level 1 exam. Probably didn't pass based on how I studied. In any case, if you're still going to try maybe we can study together, or at least be distance motivators. Feel free to email me. -Vince: Berkeleyvi@gmail.com
Good Luck on our Exams

I'm also looking for a diligent study partner for the June 2014 LSAT and looking to score  above 175. I would say my best section would be logic games as I rarely miss a question for those questions.

Hey Anthony,

I am looking for a study partner for USMLE step I. I am thinking maybe Skyping twice or 3x a week or something 1 month before the exam and maybe once a week before that. I have never studied with anyone over the internet. The thing is that if you do it with friends, it takes forever to get anything done (we always get off track), but with someone online, I imagine you can be really efficient. Are are looking for something similar?
